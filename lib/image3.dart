                '''The Mercedes-Benz 190E Evolution is a high-performance version of the 190E, a compact executive car produced by Mercedes-Benz from the 1980s. The "Evolution" models, specifically the 190E 2.5-16 Evolution I and Evolution II, were developed for homologation purposes, allowing Mercedes to participate in the German Touring Car Championship (DTM).

The 190E Evolution I was introduced in 1989, featuring a 2.5-liter 16-valve engine producing around 195 horsepower. It had a sportier suspension, aerodynamic enhancements, and other performance improvements.

The Evolution II followed in 1990, with an upgraded engine pushing around 235 horsepower. It featured a more aggressive body kit with a distinctive rear spoiler, wider fenders, and larger wheels. Only 502 units of the Evolution II were produced, making it a rare and sought-after collector's car.

Both Evolution models are highly regarded for their performance and racing heritage, contributing to the 190E's reputation as a sporty and iconic model in Mercedes-Benz history.''',
